# Adapt + repair checks

Apply when adapting or repairing project checks; use native diagnostics for enforced requirements.

Plan migration: Ready/Complete plans now need an explicit `E2E:` disposition. When reopening or validating an older plan, derive it from that plan's recorded runtime evidence or a concrete inapplicability reason; missing evidence remains pending. Do not relabel historical tests as fresh execution or turn local proof into remote delivery.

| Agent decision | Required proof |
| --- | --- |
| Package/source coverage | Match actual production owners, nested packages + native workspaces. Review scan roots, generated/vendor attributes, ignored files and dynamic entry points; a clean report cannot prove omitted code was examined. |
| Affected selection | `depends_on` = reviewed direct package-impact edges from native manifests, workspace/service setup and root lockfile/tool providers; traversal includes transitive dependents. `impact_inputs` adds repository-relative file/directory inputs read by a package's checks, including cross-language contracts and documentation used as data; match exact paths or descendants, including deletions. Missing dependency mapping is unknown, not `[]`, so package checks stay full. Plans/top-level Markdown run only the secret scan when no declared input consumes them. Hard Eng config, workflow and scaffold changes stay full. Review imported schemas, generated sources and shared configuration before narrowing scope; selected packages still run their full suites and coverage. |
| CI ownership | Inspect existing jobs before assigning Hard Eng work. Each required assertion has one job/owner; compare arguments, reports and thresholds before removing duplicates. Keep local native checks; integrate missing CI assertions into existing jobs and name their required results in `shipping.checks`. Setup preserves existing workflows and leaves adaptation pending; it generates a new workflow only with a project shipping policy. |
| Import boundaries | Derive public/private interfaces + allowed dependencies from actual architecture. Prove allowed → pass, forbidden → fail, restored → pass, including relevant aliases, exports + test imports. Do not invent boundaries to satisfy a gate. |
| Performance | Choose representative workloads/environment + justified latency, memory, frame or operation budgets. Intentionally exceed each budget to prove failure. Flutter rendering needs profile-mode device measurements; debug unit tests are insufficient. See [Efficiency](efficiency.md) for bulk/async cases. |
| Security + dependencies | Review actual trust boundaries, native exclusions, extractor coverage + selected lockfiles/images. Confirm the scanned image is the intended build; scanner success does not establish exploitability or complete coverage. With a resolvable `--base`, the `secrets-history` gate's `--log-opts=--all` scans only `base..HEAD`, because earlier commits were scanned when they entered; without a base, or with one Git cannot resolve, it scans the full history. |
| Missing inputs | Repair missing/stale coverage, reports, generated sources or comparison refs at their producer/selection owner. Preserve the required metric, threshold and scope; disabling the metric or asserting the disabled configuration in a test does not repair the input. Unavailable proof remains a failed/blocked check. |
| Exceptions | Only proven false positives or intentional supported patterns; narrow native exception + adjacent reason/evidence. Keep the rule active elsewhere. No baseline, tolerance, ignore list, inline disable, raised threshold or hidden warning for an actual finding: repair it in code, even when it is unrelated to the task, and commit that repair before the task continues. |
| Parallelism | Opt in only independent commands with distinct outputs; account for child workers, memory + connections. Builds, generators and report cleaners may need ordering. Setup runs a generated pytest gate with `pytest-xdist` and `-n auto`, and upgrades an older serial one on update. A suite that shares a database, port or fixed file across tests fails under it: isolate that state per worker, or keep the suite serial by setting `-n 0` in the gate command, which setup preserves. |

When no meaningful performance workload and justified budget exist, review the package's responsibilities and actual consumers before recording a nonblank `performance_exception` string in that package's gate group. Include the reason, inspected evidence and changes that require revisiting it. Package size or language alone is insufficient; missing tests or an inconvenient failing budget is not an exception. Remove only the unused template performance placeholder after review. Setup preserves the declaration and omitted check; every configured performance suite still runs with serial execution and native report validation. Unit tests, coverage and all other strict checks remain mandatory. The parser validates the declaration's shape, not the review's correctness.

CI adaptation is one-time repository work, not a second check runner or receipt store. Reuse native job dependencies and failure propagation; required checks must report for affected and unaffected changes. A deploy job can `needs:` a job that `uses: ./.github/workflows/hard-eng.yml` with the `base_sha` input; the called check reports as `<caller job> / hard-eng`, which `shipping.checks` must name. Wire reviewed package impact before relying on `--base`; unknown mappings intentionally run full scope. Provision only the selected owners' tools, reuse native caches without stale-version fallback, and measure both critical-path time and runner minutes. Do not widen timeouts to conceal duplication. A build/performance/browser prerequisite remains required when its consumer moves jobs.

Measure setup, checks, waiting and deployment separately. Replace a runner polling another workflow with native `needs`/reusable-workflow ordering, then remove duplicate triggers. Keep cache restore keys within the selected tool set and use the same package-manager store before dependency installation. Resolve each native workspace's locked dependencies once per job, before its consumers; remove duplicate workflow/wrapper installs only when the retained owner supplies the same dependencies and lifecycle scripts. Keep code generation once before its checks, retaining output-drift assertions; use Flutter's `--no-pub` only after the locked dependency gate succeeds. Remove repeated tests/scans only after comparing scope, tool versions, arguments and report thresholds. Dart Decimate's unfiltered strict `check` already includes boundary findings; its `--boundary-violations` option filters output and must not be added to the combined dead-code/duplicate gate.

`shipping.ci_seconds` bounds each named check's reported execution time. A three-second aggregate does not measure its upstream jobs: retain meaningful worker checks in the policy and measured native workflow/job timeouts. Report end-to-end CI elapsed time separately; do not claim a whole-pipeline budget from the aggregate's duration. Existing monoliths require a deliberate assertion-by-assertion migration before removing their product triggers; setup never deletes them automatically.

Use existing [Python](../templates/hard-eng.python.json), [JavaScript](../templates/hard-eng.javascript.json) or [Dart/Flutter](../templates/hard-eng.dart.json) templates when adapting a new package. Do not copy a template over project-specific contracts.

## Plan checks

Load for planning-stage checks or plan validation failures. Use [HE Plan](../../he-plan/SKILL.md) for readiness + authorization; [PLAN.md](../../he-plan/templates/PLAN.md) owns required fields.

| Command | Required declaration |
| --- | --- |
| `python3 .hooks/hard-eng.py check --plan-stage Draft` | Filled plan; permits pending baseline/intermediate verification. |
| `python3 .hooks/hard-eng.py check --plan-stage Ready` | Ready or Complete; baseline Passed with evidence; UX Passed with a rendered Mock/Existing/New proposal image or reasoned N/A; explicit E2E disposition; no declared blockers. |
| `python3 .hooks/hard-eng.py check --plan-stage Complete` | Complete; above requirements + implementation evidence, no unchecked requirements, and no pending local E2E. Deployment-only E2E requires Deploy and configured delivery checks. |

Every command also runs native project checks and the AGENTS.md comment rule: each changed source file, generated output aside, may hold only one-line comments. Ordinary `check` (including pre-push/CI) requires Complete for non-Markdown changes; Markdown-only planning can stop at Draft/Ready. Stop checks at Ready while every unfinished applicable plan is Ready with Verification Pending (a build in progress), unless a line of the turn opens with the HE Build handoff `Ready for ship —`. Changed root/feature plans take precedence; otherwise active plans apply. An unchanged historical Complete plan cannot cover new work relative to a known base. Missing bases fail plan validation; a new branch's zero base compares with its merge base on the `shipping.base` remote branch, and an unborn repository or missing remote branch uses Git's empty tree (the whole initial snapshot). Unchanged Complete plans keep their recorded rules: a missing `E2E:` field fails only once the plan is edited. Unchanged repositories can still be audited without inventing a task plan.

Draft Stop requires an explicit `Handoff: Clarification` with a real prerequisite question, or `Handoff: Approval` with baseline, UX and E2E planning evidence. Missing/invalid declarations and incomplete approval evidence block; a clarification does not waive another plan's requirements. This is a declared handoff check, not a trusted approval record or proof of the conversation's meaning. See [HE Plan](../../he-plan/SKILL.md#readiness--authorization).

Plan-only edits after a matching passed baseline → use the same stage command with `--base HEAD` to validate the plan and affected checks. The baseline must cover the current code/configuration/environment; the base flag cannot substitute for that proof. Uncommitted code/config changes remain in the comparison, unknown impact retains full scope, and required pre-push/CI checks still run. Do not repeat the whole application suite solely for plan wording or a Draft-to-Ready declaration change.

The check validates structure + declarations, not evidence truth, approval, relevance or delivery chronology. A passing Draft/Ready run is not implementation completion. Baseline Exception is rejected. If the Ready or Complete command fails, return the same plan to Draft with the actual blocker; do not replace failure with N/A or leave a false Ready/Complete claim. Starting failures follow [baseline repair](#baseline-repair); build regressions stay in their current effort. Neither route may weaken checks to bypass actual findings.

## Baseline repair

  A -->|Yes| R[Separate repair plan + task branch]
  R --> B[HE Build: baseline repairs only from truthful Draft]
  B --> C[All native checks pass + repair plan Complete]
  C --> S[HE Ship: merge repairs + verify main CI and delivery]
  S --> N[Fresh feature branch from verified main + new baseline]

```

- Repair scope = all actual enforced baseline failures, including pre-existing debt and findings unrelated to the task or surfaced by a newer tool release; age, effort or relevance is not an exemption. Correct proven false positives only under the existing [native exception rule](#adapt--repair-checks). Reuse valid user authorization; otherwise ask for the missing repair/delivery scope.
- Repair is the sole failed-baseline implementation route: record failures, bounded repair steps + intended proof before edits. Preserve the original failed evidence; after repair, record the passing rerun as current baseline and complete normal build checks. Never declare Ready while checks fail.
- Feature resumes only after the repair revision is on the intended main branch and required CI/delivery checks pass. An open PR or local pass is insufficient. Keep repair and feature plans/diffs separate; apply the feature's original authorization and readiness rules after updating its baseline.
