# Widget Previews


## Read first

1. Import `package:flutter/widget_previews.dart` only in preview files/preview blocks.
2. Wrap preview targets in app shell/theme/localization (`AppPreviewShell` or project equivalent).
3. Override repos/datasources/auth/config/clock with fakes. No real backends.
4. No native plugins, platform channels, `dart:io`, Firebase, Hive boxes, or real HTTP.
5. Use deterministic small data and central `AppWidgetKeys`; preview surfaces, not full runtime screens.

## Trigger

Signals: @Preview, AppPreviewShell, widget_previews, provider overrides, preview fakes


## Rules

1. **MUST** import `package:flutter/widget_previews.dart` only in preview files or preview-only blocks.
2. **MUST** wrap preview targets in the app theme/shell used by production widgets.
3. **MUST** override Riverpod providers with fakes for repository, datasource, auth, config, and clock dependencies.
4. **MUST NOT** call native plugins, `dart:io`, platform channels, Firebase, Hive boxes, or real HTTP from previews.
5. **MUST NOT** add `@Preview` to stateful app screens that require full runtime boot. Create a small preview surface instead.
6. **MUST** keep preview data deterministic and small.
7. **MUST** preserve the central key registry rule. Use `ValueKey(AppWidgetKeys.someAction)`, never inline string keys.

## File Placement

Prefer one preview file next to the widget:

```text
features/products/presentation/widgets/
  product_card.dart
  product_card_preview.dart
```

If the project already has a preview convention, follow it.

## Preview Shell

Create one app-owned shell so every preview gets theme, localization, text
scale, and provider overrides consistently.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';

class AppPreviewShell extends StatelessWidget {
  const AppPreviewShell({
    super.key,
    required this.child,
    this.overrides = const [],
  });

  final Widget child;
  final List<Override> overrides;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ProviderScope(
      overrides: overrides,
      child: MaterialApp(
        theme: buildAppTheme(),
        home: Scaffold(body: SafeArea(child: child)),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Riverpod Preview Pattern

Keep the widget itself production-real. Override only dependencies.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter/widget_previews.dart';

@Preview(name: 'Product card - in stock')
Widget productCardInStockPreview() {
  return AppPreviewShell(
    overrides: [
      productRepositoryProvider.overrideWithValue(
        FakeProductRepository(
          products: const [
            Product(id: 'preview-1', name: 'Suture Kit', price: 24),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    ],
    child: const ProductCard(productId: 'preview-1'),
  );
}
```

## Preview Fakes

Use simple fakes that implement interfaces. Do not mock notifiers directly.

```dart
class FakeProductRepository implements IProductRepository {
  const FakeProductRepository({required this.products});

  final List<Product> products;

  @override
  Future<List<Product>> fetchAll() async => products;

  @override
  Future<Product?> fetchById(String id) async {
    for (final product in products) {
      if (product.id == id) {
        return product;
      }
    }
    return null;
  }
}
```

## Preview Matrix

For reusable widgets, add enough previews to catch real UI states:

| State | Required preview |
|---|---|
| Empty/null | Empty state surface |
| Loading | Skeleton/spinner state if visible |
| Data | Typical content |
| Long text | Longest likely localized string |
| Error | Non-sensitive failure message |
| Theme | Light and dark when supported |
| Width | Compact and expanded when layout changes |

## Limitations

- Previewer runs in a web-like environment. Native plugins and file/database APIs can fail.
- Previewer is visual feedback. Keep widget/unit/E2E tests for behavior.
- If preview setup needs many overrides, the widget is likely too coupled. Move platform or data work behind interfaces.

## Checklist

- [ ] Preview target imports `package:flutter/widget_previews.dart`.
- [ ] Preview target uses `AppPreviewShell` or the project equivalent.
- [ ] Repositories/datasources/services are faked through provider overrides.
- [ ] No native plugin, Hive, Firebase, platform channel, or real HTTP call runs in preview.
- [ ] Long text, empty, error, and compact/expanded states are covered when applicable.
- [ ] No inline string `ValueKey`s were added.
