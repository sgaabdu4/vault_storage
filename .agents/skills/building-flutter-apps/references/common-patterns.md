# Common Patterns


## Read first

1. Typed GoRouter helpers only. No raw route strings at call sites.
2. `ref.mounted` after every notifier await; `context.mounted` after widget await.
3. GoRouter redirect uses `ref.listen` + `refreshListenable`, never `ref.watch`; loading returns `null`.
4. Route-id lookups in `build()` are nullable + fallback UI; never throw.
5. Modals pop results only. Teardown lives in notifier. High-frequency boundaries debounce/gate/batch.
6. Splash/cover routing does not wait for background initial sync; route to the shell once auth/setup are known.
7. Provider-derived caches have one SSOT: computed provider, notifier/repo state, or memoized service/repo/datasource cache.
8. Widgets dispatch only. No `try/catch`, awaited notifier-result branching, top-level/global helper functions, `*Data` collection helper namespaces, or private collection derivation helpers.
9. Route-current guards use `context.isCurrentModalRoute`; never inline raw `ModalRoute` current-route checks.

## Trigger

Signals: pagination, search debounce, form validation, GoRouter redirect, typed routes


## Rules — NEVER Violate

1. **MUST** use generated typed GoRouter route helpers as the navigation SSOT. Call `SomeRoute(...).go(context)` / `.push<T>(context)` directly. Route definitions own paths and params. Local sheet/dialog helpers own modal presentation and dismissal.
2. **NEVER** use `ref.watch()` inside GoRouter `redirect` — recreates router every state change.
3. **MUST** guard `if (!ref.mounted) return;` after EVERY `await` in notifiers (pagination, search, forms, sync).
4. **MUST** use `ref.listen()` + `refreshListenable` for GoRouter redirect triggers — NEVER `ref.watch()`.
5. **MUST** debounce search inputs (<=150ms) — NEVER call API on every keystroke.
6. **During loading, stay put.** Return `null` from redirect — NEVER bounce to splash on web refresh.
7. **MUST** guard page back with a typed fallback route for deep-link/resume safety.
8. **NEVER** keep splash/cover routes mounted while initial sync runs. After auth/setup state resolves, route to the shell and let sync hydrate local data in the background. Lint: `router_splash_waits_for_initial_sync`.
9. **Route-id lookups in widget `build()` MUST be nullable.** Use by-id provider + fallback UI. Never throw in `build()`.
10. **Wizard/deep-link mutation order MUST be:** persist write → targeted parent sync → navigate.
11. **Repo mounted rule:** keep `context.mounted` in widget async flows. Never swap to `mounted` to silence lint; refactor flow instead.
12. **NEVER** hand-wire zone/framework/dispatcher error handlers. Keep one startup owner: `await Crash.init(appRunner: () => runApp(...))`. See [error-reporting.md](error-reporting.md).
13. **MUST** keep the app shell declarative. The widget that returns `MaterialApp`, `CupertinoApp`, or `WidgetsApp` owns shell config only. Put root bootstrap listeners in a sibling/dedicated `ConsumerWidget` under `ProviderScope`; use `ref.watch` for eager initialization and `ref.listen` for UI side effects. Lint: `app_shell_bootstrap_side_effects`.
14. **NEVER** put controller logic or provider-derived caches in widgets. No widget `try/catch`, no `final ok = await ref.read(xProvider.notifier).save(); if (ok) ...`, no local `_isSaving` / `_isSubmitting` flags beside provider mutations, no top-level/global widget helper functions, no `ProviderSubscription` fields, no `ref.listenManual`, no `*Data` helper namespaces that filter/map/sort/index collections, and no private widget filtering/sorting/cache helpers. Cache/index/snapshot/mutation state belongs to one provider/notifier/repo/service SSOT. Lints: `riverpod_consumer_state_derived_cache`, `riverpod_consumer_state_provider_subscription`, `riverpod_listen_manual_forbidden`, `widget_top_level_function_boundary`, `widget_try_catch_boundary`, `widget_awaits_notifier_result`, `widget_local_mutation_flag`, `widget_derived_collection_logic`.
15. **MUST** use `context.isCurrentModalRoute` for route-current guards. Do not inline `ModalRoute.of(context).isCurrent`, local `route.isCurrent`, or `ModalRoute.isCurrentOf(context)` outside `core/extensions/context_extensions.dart`. Lint: `use_context_is_current_modal_route`.
