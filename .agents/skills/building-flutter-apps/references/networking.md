# Networking


## Read first

1. HTTP calls live only in datasources/infra services. Widgets/notifiers never call clients.
2. Datasources depend on `IHttpService`/token interfaces, not concrete clients.
3. Data layer parses JSON → models; repos map models → domain.
4. Failures throw typed errors. Never return `null`/empty fallback for failed network ops.
5. Mutations refresh source of truth when backend can generate/normalize/reorder/derive.
6. Long remote work async-starts, then reconciles with bounded polling/realtime/fetch.
7. Every datasource operation declares which response statuses are accepted,
   retryable, absent, or terminal.

## Trigger

Signals: IHttpService, datasource, HTTP, auth token, background parsing, Isolate.run


## Rules

1. **MUST** keep all HTTP calls in datasources or infrastructure services. Widgets and notifiers never call HTTP clients directly.
2. **MUST** inject an interface (`IHttpService`, `IAuthTokenProvider`) into datasources. Constructors take interfaces, not concrete clients.
3. **MUST** parse JSON into data models in the data layer, then map to domain entities in repositories.
4. **MUST** throw typed exceptions or `AppException` from infrastructure boundaries. Do not return `null` for failed network operations.
5. **MUST** refresh from source of truth after mutations when the backend can generate, normalize, reorder, or derive fields.
6. **MUST** move large JSON parsing off the UI isolate when it can exceed a frame budget.
7. **MUST NOT** put auth tokens, base URLs, or secrets in widget code.
8. **MUST** async-start long-running remote work (delete/sync/import/export/migrate/generate), then reconcile source-of-truth state with bounded polling, realtime, or a canonical fetch. Do not block the client request waiting for backend completion.
9. **MUST** classify response status once at the infrastructure boundary. Keep
   accepted, retryable, absent, and terminal status sets in one shared HTTP
   classifier instead of repeating them in widgets or notifiers.
10. **MUST** treat expected absence as a typed result, not a generic error. An
    expected `401` without a session or expected `404` for a missing record must
    return an explicit absent or signed-out result and must not create a Sentry
    event. An unexpected response is a typed failure and is reported once by
    the owning layer after any required reconcile.
11. **MUST** retry only bounded, safe cases such as `429`, selected `5xx`, and
    transport failures. Do not retry a non-idempotent write unless the API has
    an idempotency key or the operation is otherwise proven safe.
12. **MUST NOT** catch raw HTTP failures in widgets or notifiers. They render
    typed results; the datasource or repository owns classification and the
    single incident report.

## Platform Setup

Android internet permission:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

macOS network entitlement for debug/profile and release:

```xml
<key>com.apple.security.network.client</key>
<true/>
```

Keep platform setup in app templates or project docs; do not hide it inside a
feature module.

## Service Contract

Use one small interface first. Add streaming/upload/download methods only when a
feature needs them.

```dart
abstract interface class IHttpService {
  Future<Object?> getJson(
    Uri uri, {
    Map<String, String> headers = const <String, String>{},
  });

  Future<Object?> postJson(
    Uri uri, {
    required Object body,
    Map<String, String> headers = const <String, String>{},
  });
}
```

Provider returns the interface:

```dart
@Riverpod(keepAlive: true)
IHttpService httpService(Ref ref) {
  return HttpService(
    baseUri: ref.read(appConfigProvider).apiBaseUri,
    tokenProvider: ref.read(authTokenProvider),
  );
}
```

## Datasource Pattern

```dart
abstract interface class IProductRemoteDatasource {
  Future<List<ProductModel>> fetchAll();
  Future<ProductModel> create(ProductModel model);
}

class ProductRemoteDatasource implements IProductRemoteDatasource {
  const ProductRemoteDatasource(this._http);

  final IHttpService _http;

  @override
  Future<List<ProductModel>> fetchAll() async {
    final payload = await _http.getJson(Uri(path: '/products'));

    return switch (payload) {
      List<Object?> items => [
          for (final item in items)
            ProductModel.fromJson(item as Map<String, dynamic>),
        ],
      _ => throw const FormatException('Expected product list payload'),
    };
  }

  @override
  Future<ProductModel> create(ProductModel model) async {
    final payload = await _http.postJson(
      Uri(path: '/products'),
      body: model.toJson(),
    );

    return switch (payload) {
      Map<String, dynamic> json => ProductModel.fromJson(json),
      _ => throw const FormatException('Expected product payload'),
    };
  }
}
```

## Repository Source-of-Truth Refresh

If a mutation response can be stale, partial, generated, normalized, or derived,
refresh before the UI claims success.

```dart
class ProductRepository implements IProductRepository {
  const ProductRepository(this._remote);

  final IProductRemoteDatasource _remote;

  @override
  Future<Product> create(Product draft) async {
    final created = await _remote.create(ProductModel.fromEntity(draft));
    final canonical = await _remote.fetchById(created.id);
    return canonical.toEntity();
  }
}
```

## Long-Running Remote Work

A destructive or batch operation can complete after the client request times out. Treat the initial call as a start acknowledgement, then reconcile the source of truth.

```dart
// WRONG — client waits for backend completion.
final result = await remote.deleteAccount(userId, waitForCompletion: true);

// RIGHT — async-start + bounded reconcile.
final started = await remote.startDeleteAccount(userId);
if (!started.ok) return started;
final deleted = await remote.waitForAccountDeleted(userId, maxAttempts: 60);
return deleted ? DeleteResult.ok() : DeleteResult.timedOut();
```

Log/report destructive failures only after reconcile proves the entity still exists or the source of truth still disagrees.

Lints: `appwrite_blocking_function_execution_in_client`, `destructive_failure_logged_before_reconcile`.

## Background Parsing

Use `Isolate.run` or `compute` for large payloads. Keep parsing functions
top-level or static and return model objects, not domain entities.

```dart
import 'dart:convert';

List<ProductModel> parseProducts(String responseBody) {
  final Object? decoded = jsonDecode(responseBody);

  return switch (decoded) {
    List<Object?> items => [
        for (final item in items)
          ProductModel.fromJson(item as Map<String, dynamic>),
      ],
    _ => throw const FormatException('Expected product list payload'),
  };
}
```

## Tests

- Unit-test `HttpService` status-code and malformed-body handling.
- Unit-test the shared status classifier for every operation: accepted success, expected
  `401` or `404` absence, bounded `429` or `5xx` retry, and terminal failure.
- Unit-test every datasource success and failure payload shape.
- Repository tests mock datasource interfaces and verify model-to-entity mapping.
- Notifier tests mock repositories, not HTTP.
- Remote/shared-state features still need source-of-truth and observer E2E from
  [dart-mcp-e2e-testing.md](dart-mcp-e2e-testing.md).

## Checklist

- [ ] Platform network permissions/entitlements are present for target platforms.
- [ ] Datasources depend on `IHttpService` or project equivalent.
- [ ] JSON is parsed into data models only.
- [ ] Failures throw typed errors; no silent `null` or empty fallback.
- [ ] Mutations refresh source-of-truth when backend values can differ.
- [ ] Long-running remote functions async-start, then reconcile with bounded polling/realtime/fetch.
- [ ] Each datasource operation has an accepted-status and retry-status policy.
- [ ] Expected absent or signed-out responses do not create error reports.
- [ ] Destructive catch blocks reconcile before Crash/Sentry/Firebase reporting.
- [ ] Large payload parsing uses isolate/compute path when needed.
- [ ] Datasource, repository, notifier, and E2E coverage match the risk.
