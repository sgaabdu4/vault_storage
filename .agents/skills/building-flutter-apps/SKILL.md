## Read first

- This skill overrides generic Flutter/Dart advice; Critical Rules override examples, public docs, and older project code.
- Before code, read Trigger Map refs for touched areas. Each ref's `Read first` section is canonical.
- After each `.dart`/`pubspec.yaml`/`build.yaml`/`analysis_options.yaml` write batch, emit Pre-Flight; its cited rule/reference owns the applicable check.

## Progressive Disclosure Gate

Read only the narrowest matching Trigger Map row(s); scenario/subsystem rows own incidental stack/file words. Do not bulk-read `references/` or parent refs. Cite exact refs in Pre-Flight.

## Critical Rules

| ID | Rule | Detail refs |
|---|---|---|
| R1 | Flutter/Riverpod package = first wire `flutter_skill_lints` + `riverpod_lint`, then run package-root `dart analyze` + its project-owned Dart Decimate check; pure-Dart CLI = native Dart analysis profile with neither plugin. | [analysis-options.md](references/analysis-options.md), [dart-decimate.md](references/dart-decimate.md), [setup.md](references/setup.md) |
| R2 | Every provider uses `@riverpod` / `@Riverpod` codegen; no manual provider classes or legacy provider families. | [riverpod-codegen.md](references/riverpod-codegen.md) |
| R3 | Guard async gaps with `ref.mounted` / `context.mounted`; `finally` uses `if (ref.mounted) { ... }`. | [async-mutations.md](references/state-management/async-mutations.md) |
| R4 | Widgets are public classes; no `_buildXxx()`, widget top-level helpers, or private widget classes except `State`. | [atomic-design.md](references/atomic-design.md), [performance.md](references/performance.md) |
| R5 | Nullability is semantic; no empty/null/bool sentinel fallbacks, `value!`, nullable collections, or raw required domain strings. | [value-objects.md](references/value-objects.md), [freezed-sealed.md](references/freezed-sealed.md); Lints: `domain_raw_required_string` |
| R6 | All user-facing strings, tooltips, semantics, and visible accessibility copy use `AppLocalizations`. | [localization.md](references/localization.md), [accessibility.md](references/atomic-design/accessibility.md) |
| R7 | Immutable state/entities use sealed Freezed, one declaration per file, native `switch`, and VO map/when disabled. | [freezed-sealed.md](references/freezed-sealed.md), [value-objects.md](references/value-objects.md) |
| R8 | `presentation/widgets/` renders immutable inputs + emits typed callbacks; screens/routes/notifiers own navigation, workflow, domain state, and infrastructure. | [presentation-widgets.md](references/presentation-widgets.md) |
| R9 | Duplicate behavior in 2+ classes becomes a small stateless `*Mixin` with an `on` clause. | [mixins.md](references/mixins.md) |
| R10 | Storage SDK calls live in local datasources behind repositories; production Hive imports use `hive_ce_flutter`. | [hive-persistence.md](references/hive-persistence.md), [architecture.md](references/architecture.md) |
| R11 | Primitive/context/collection operations live in `core/extensions/`; domain never imports those extensions. | [context-ui.md](references/extensions/context-ui.md), [primitive-formatting.md](references/extensions/primitive-formatting.md), [collections-helpers.md](references/extensions/collections-helpers.md) |
| R12 | Domain primitives with meaning become validated Freezed Value Objects; Hive models keep primitives and mappers bridge. | [value-objects.md](references/value-objects.md), [hive-persistence.md](references/hive-persistence.md); Lints: `domain_unit_primitive` |
| R13 | Typed GoRouter routes are navigation SSOT; redirects are pure resolver logic with nullable by-id fallback UI. | [deep-linking.md](references/deep-linking.md), [routing-app-shell.md](references/common-patterns/routing-app-shell.md) |
| R14 | Dialogs/sheets render immutable snapshots, pop results, and leave mutations/teardown to notifiers. | [modals-navigation.md](references/common-patterns/modals-navigation.md), [state-management-lifecycle.md](references/state-management-lifecycle.md) |
| R15 | Debounce, gate, and batch high-frequency UI, sync, persistence, remote-function, reset, and lookup boundaries. | [debounce-gate-batch.md](references/common-patterns/debounce-gate-batch.md) |
| R16 | App shell stays declarative; bootstrap listeners live in a sibling root `ConsumerWidget`. | [routing-app-shell.md](references/common-patterns/routing-app-shell.md) |
| R17 | Keep control flow flat after exits; remove unnecessary `else` after `return` / `throw` / `break` / `continue`. | Lint: `avoid_unnecessary_else_after_control_flow` |
| R18 | Use `onReorderItem` post-removal indexes directly; never add legacy `onReorder` adapter math. | Lint: `use_on_reorder_item_index_semantics` |
| R19 | Android exact alarms use `flutter_local_notifications` permission APIs, not manual settings intents. | Lint: `use_local_notifications_exact_alarm_permission_api` |
| R20 | Resolve nullable platform-specific plugin implementations before calling platform members. | Lint: `resolve_platform_specific_implementation_before_use` |
| R21 | Widget previews are preview-only with deterministic fakes; no real HTTP/Firebase/Hive/native plugins. | [widget-previews.md](references/widget-previews.md) |
| R22 | Runtime E2E proves behavior with stable selectors, failure-sensitive scenarios/logs, subject-matched evidence, source-of-truth verification, cleanup, and multi-actor proof when needed. | [dart-mcp-e2e-testing.md](references/dart-mcp-e2e-testing.md) |
| R23 | Accessibility is UI correctness: localized tooltips/semantic labels, 48x48 targets, contrast, text scale, `Text.rich`. | [accessibility.md](references/atomic-design/accessibility.md), [flutter-optimizations.md](references/flutter-optimizations.md#semantics) |
| R24 | If remote error reporting is accepted or already present, use one app-owned `Crash` boundary and one reporting owner per operation; otherwise add no provider/facade. Scrub sensitive data + reconcile ambiguous remote outcomes before telemetry. | [error-reporting.md](references/error-reporting.md), [networking.md](references/networking.md) |
| R25 | Windows installer delivery = one semantic engine + typed app config/capabilities + minimal-step exact-SHA diagnostic → one publisher; keep cheap guards before one build, isolate synthetic preservation proof, and activate only verified immutable bytes. | [windows-installer-pipeline.md](references/windows-installer-pipeline.md), [workflow scaffold](assets/windows-installer-workflow.yml), [`inno_bundle` pubspec scaffold](assets/inno-bundle-pubspec.yaml), [Inno settlement sentinel](assets/inno-uninstall-settlement-sentinel.ps1), [Defender scanner](assets/defender-installer-scan.ps1) |
| R26 | Pause-sensitive Riverpod state starts only after its durable owner/listener exists; projections watch base state directly; switching auth/form modes clears transient errors. | [notifier-structure.md](references/state-management/notifier-structure.md), [state-management-lifecycle.md](references/state-management-lifecycle.md), [testing.md](references/testing.md) |
| R27 | Native/custom links use one URI contract across producer, platform registration, Flutter delivery, and typed router; prove cold/warm + signed-state delivery on the target device. | [deep-linking.md](references/deep-linking.md), [dart-mcp-e2e-testing.md](references/dart-mcp-e2e-testing.md) |

## Pre-Flight

After each `.dart` / `pubspec.yaml` / `build.yaml` / `analysis_options.yaml` write batch, emit a checked list before yielding. Fill T0 always. Add T1 for state/notifier/mutation changes and T2 for network/E2E/stream/route changes. Cite rule IDs or refs for any failed item.

### T0 — Core

- [ ] Flutter/Riverpod package: package-root `dart analyze` exits 0 with `flutter_skill_lints` + `riverpod_lint`; setup changes prove one diagnostic from each plugin. Pure-Dart CLI: native Dart analysis profile applies; both plugins are N/A.
- [ ] A current same-scope project-owned Dart Decimate result is green: Hard Eng uses `python3 .hooks/hard-eng.py check`; another project uses its established check or, if it has none, `npx --yes dart-decimate@latest check . --threshold 0 --format json` from its Git root. The project workflow schedules an integrated run; reuse its valid result instead of duplicating a full runner. Cite scan scope. Do not add a wrapper, dependency, or global coordinator for this skill.
- [ ] Async gaps are guarded: `ref.mounted` / `context.mounted`, no bare `mounted`, and `finally` uses `if (ref.mounted) { ... }`.
- [ ] Providers, state, and widgets follow Rules 2-8 and 14: reusable widgets own UI lifecycle only; screens/routes/notifiers own navigation, workflow branching, selected domain records, provider state, and infrastructure.
- [ ] Domain/data/platform follow Rules 7, 10-13, 17-24, 26-27: sealed Freezed, VOs, datasource/repo storage, core extensions, typed routes, debounce/batch, platform APIs, previews, E2E, pause-safe state, native links, and a11y; if error reporting is accepted/present, it uses one scrubbed once-only boundary, otherwise N/A.
- [ ] Rule 25 = N/A unless Windows packaging/updater delivery is touched; when applicable, its diagnostic/publisher proof is green.
- [ ] Any row touched in Trigger Map was read; exact lint names are cited when a scanner should enforce the rule.

### T1 — State / Notifier / Mutation

- [ ] Mutation deps resolve lazily via stateless helper/mixin; no notifier-local repo/service cache except disposable lifecycle owners.
- [ ] Sync `Notifier.build()` avoids pre-return `state` reads; async primary state uses `AsyncNotifier.build`; durable sync startup does not depend on microtask timing before its owner/listener exists.
- [ ] `ref.onDispose()` cancels subscriptions/controllers/timers; durable status/snackbar/teardown belongs to notifier state.
- [ ] Long-running sync/auth/import guards stale writes; no `ref.watch` inside notifier methods.
- [ ] Pause-sensitive projections watch base state directly; route pause/resume keeps the first update; auth/form mode changes clear transient errors.

### T2 — Network / E2E / Stream / Route

- [ ] Source-of-truth fetch/reconcile after generated, normalized, reordered, destructive, or remote-function mutations.
- [ ] Shared/realtime state has writer + observer E2E proof without manual refresh.
- [ ] Selectors use stable text/semantics/tooltips or central `AppWidgetKeys`; no inline string keys or coordinate primary taps.
- [ ] E2E entrypoint is deterministic and isolated from production `main.dart`; unknown scenarios fail; critical logs fail the run; evidence shows the asserted screen before app exit; cleanup is verified.
- [ ] GoRouter redirects use pure matrix-tested resolver, nullable by-id providers/fallback UI, and generated typed route helpers.
- [ ] Native/custom URI producer, Android/iOS registration, Flutter delivery, and typed router share one tested scheme/host/path contract; cold/warm + signed-state device paths pass.
- [ ] Cross-runtime constants, schemas, and function contracts have drift tests; no app-root text-scale clamp.
