    await storage.init();

#### With security features
    final storage = VaultStorage.create(
      securityConfig: VaultSecurityConfig.production(
        watcherMail: 'security@mycompany.com',
        androidPackageName: 'com.mycompany.myapp',
        androidSigningCertHashes: ['your_cert_hash'],
        iosBundleId: 'com.mycompany.myapp',
        iosTeamId: 'YOUR_TEAM_ID',
      ),

## [2.1.1] - 2025-08-11
### Web compatibility and quality
- fix: Remove `dart:isolate` from the public import graph and use `compute` from `flutter/foundation`, enabling web platform detection on pub.dev.
- fix: Use conditional imports that default to web-safe stubs and import `dart:io` only behind `dart.library.io`.
- chore: Add explicit `platforms:` section in `pubspec.yaml` to declare support for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Web, and Windows.
- chore: Add IO stubs in web mocks to satisfy analyzer for conditional imports.
- fix: Address analyzer warnings (avoid `await` on synchronous `containsKey`).

## [2.1.0] - 2025-08-10
### New Features
- feat: Add `clearAll({bool includeFiles = true})` to wipe both key-value and file storage in one call
- feat: Extend `clearNormal()` and `clearSecure()` with `includeFiles` (default `false`) to optionally delete underlying files and file metadata for the respective storage

### Internal
- refactor: Consolidate file-clearing logic into `clearAllFilesInBox(...)` with `@visibleForTesting` for easier testing
- test: Add coverage for `clearAll`, and `includeFiles` behavior in `clearNormal` and `clearSecure`

## [2.0.0] - 2025-08-08
This release delivers a simpler, clearer API and improved performance characteristics. It replaces the BoxType/Either-based surface with intent-driven methods and exception-based error handling. File APIs are simplified to use your own keys instead of passing metadata around.

### Breaking Changes
- API surface reworked for simplicity:
  - Removed: `set(BoxType, key, value)` and `get<T>(BoxType, key)` in favor of intent-specific methods
  - Added: `saveSecure`, `saveNormal`, `get<T>(key, {bool? isSecure})`, `delete(key)`, `clearNormal()`, `clearSecure()`
  - File retrieval unified: `getFile(key, {bool? isSecure})` (replaces passing metadata to `getSecureFile`/`getNormalFile`)
  - File deletion unified: `deleteFile(key)`
- Error handling model:
  - Removed: `Either<StorageError, T>` return style
  - Added: Methods now throw `StorageError` subclasses (`StorageInitializationError`, `StorageReadError`, `StorageWriteError`, `StorageDeleteError`, `StorageDisposalError`, `StorageSerializationError`)
- Web file retrieval
  - Custom download filenames are no longer configurable via public API; sensible filenames are generated automatically based on stored extension

### New Features
- Simplified key-value API with smart lookup order (normal first, then secure) when `isSecure` is not specified
- Secure and normal file storage keyed by your own identifiers; implementation tracks metadata internally
- Large-file encryption streaming for secure files (chunked AES-GCM) to reduce memory pressure
- Performance configuration via `VaultStorageConfig` with thresholds for JSON/base64 isolate usage and secure file streaming
- More aggressive Hive compaction strategy for better on-disk efficiency
- New: `keys({bool includeFiles = true, bool? isSecure})` API to list stored keys (unique and sorted). The example app now loads keys on startup so they persist across restarts.

### Web Platform Behavior
- Auto-downloads when calling `getFile()` on web; returns `Uint8List` and triggers browser download with a smart filename
- MIME type inference from file extension for better browser handling

### Internal Improvements
- Consistent use of isolates for heavy crypto, JSON encode/decode, and base64 encode/decode
- Clear separation of responsibilities: `IVaultStorage` (interface) and `VaultStorageImpl` (implementation), with `VaultStorage.create()` factory
- File operations abstracted behind `IFileOperations` for testability

### Migration Notes
1. Initialization and errors

    - Before: `await storage.init()` returned `Either`; handled with `.fold()`
- After: `await storage.init()` throws on failure. Use try/catch around initialization and calls.

2. Key-value operations

    - Replace `set(BoxType.secure, 'k', 'v')` with `saveSecure(key: 'k', value: 'v')`
- Replace `set(BoxType.normal, 'k', 'v')` with `saveNormal(key: 'k', value: 'v')`
- Replace `get<T>(BoxType.secure, 'k')` with `get<T>('k', isSecure: true)`
- Replace `get<T>(BoxType.normal, 'k')` with `get<T>('k', isSecure: false)`
- Delete both: `delete('k')`; clear with `clearNormal()` / `clearSecure()`

3. File storage

    - Replace metadata-based retrieval (`getSecureFile(fileMetadata: ...)`) with key-based retrieval: `getFile('myKey')`
- Saving files now requires a key: `saveSecureFile(key: 'myKey', fileBytes: ..., originalFileName: 'x.jpg')`
- Delete with `deleteFile('myKey')`
- Web downloads still occur automatically on retrieval; custom filenames are not exposed


Refer to the README Migration Guide for full examples.

## [1.2.1] - 2025-07-13
### New Features
- **feat: Automatic file downloads on web platforms** - `getSecureFile()` and `getNormalFile()` now automatically trigger downloads in web browsers while maintaining native platform behavior
- **feat: Custom download filenames** - Added optional `downloadFileName` parameter to file retrieval methods for custom web download names
- **feat: Smart filename generation** - Automatically generates appropriate filenames using stored file extensions (e.g., `document.pdf`, `image.jpg`)
- **feat: MIME type detection** - Automatic MIME type detection for 15+ common file formats ensures proper browser handling

### Technical Improvements
- **feat: Modern web standards** - Migrated from deprecated `dart:html` to modern `package:web` APIs for future WebAssembly (Wasm) compatibility
- **feat: Enhanced metadata storage** - File extensions are now stored in metadata for both secure and normal files
- **feat: Conditional imports optimization** - Updated to use `dart.library.js_interop` for better web/native platform detection

- **docs: Platform behavior comparison table** - Clear documentation of differences between web and native platforms
- **docs: MIME type support documentation** - Listed all supported file types and their automatic MIME type mappings

### ðŸ”„ Backward Compatibility
- **No breaking changes** - All existing code continues to work without modifications
- **Optional parameters** - New features use optional parameters to maintain API compatibility
- **Same return types** - Methods still return `Either<StorageError, Uint8List>` as before

### Web Platform Enhancements
- **Web downloads**: Files automatically download when retrieved on web platforms
- **Smart filenames**: Uses original file extensions for meaningful download names

- **fix: Improve error handling patterns** - Better distinction between functional error handling (Either) and exception-based error handling (try-catch)

## [1.0.0] - 2025-06-26
### Breaking Changes
- **BREAKING: Remove built-in Riverpod provider** - The package no longer includes a built-in Riverpod provider to remain framework-agnostic
- **BREAKING: Hide implementation details** - Use `VaultStorage.create()` factory method instead
- **feat: Framework-agnostic design** - Users can now integrate with any state management solution or use the service directly

### New Features
- **feat: Add VaultStorage.create() factory method** - Clean API that returns `IVaultStorage` interface, hiding implementation details
- **feat: Improved API design** - Only the interface (`IVaultStorage`) is exposed to users, making the API cleaner and less confusing

### Documentation Improvements
- **docs: Add comprehensive state management integration examples** - Includes examples for Riverpod and direct usage
- **docs: Update initialisation examples** - Show how to initialise the service without Riverpod dependency
- **docs: Clarify framework-agnostic approach** - Emphasise that the package works with any state management solution
- **docs: Update all examples to use factory method** - Consistent API usage throughout documentation

### Migration Guide
**From built-in Riverpod provider:**
If you were using the built-in `vaultStorageProvider`, you can easily recreate it in your own project:

1. Add Riverpod dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml`
2. Create your own provider file following the examples in the README
3. Update your initialisation code to use your custom provider

**From VaultStorageImpl():**
Replace direct instantiation with the factory method:

    // Before
    final storage = VaultStorageImpl();
    
    // After
    final storage = VaultStorage.create();This change makes the package more flexible, reduces its dependency footprint, and provides a cleaner API.
